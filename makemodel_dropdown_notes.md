You can create a nested dropdown in your React app using the data from your spreadsheet by first converting your data into a structured format and then implementing the dropdowns.

Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Extract Data from Spreadsheet:**
   You'll need to first convert your spreadsheet into a usable format like JSON. If you’re using Excel, you can save the spreadsheet as a CSV file and then use Python or another tool to convert it to JSON. Here’s an example script using Python to convert your spreadsheet:

```python
import pandas as pd
import json

# Load the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('cars.csv')

# Group by 'Make' and collect associated models
car_data = df.groupby('Make')['Model'].apply(list).to_dict()

# Save the result as JSON
with open('car_data.json', 'w') as json_file:
    json.dump(car_data, json_file)
```

This will create a `car_data.json` file with the structure:
```json
{
  "Toyota": ["Corolla", "Camry", "Prius"],
  "Honda": ["Civic", "Accord", "CR-V"],
  ...
}
```

### 2. **Load the Data into React:**
   Once you have your JSON, load it into your React component. You can import it or fetch it from a server.

Here’s an example assuming you have the `car_data.json` locally:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import carData from './car_data.json'; // Assuming JSON is stored locally

function CarDropdown() {
  const [selectedMake, setSelectedMake] = useState('');
  const [selectedModel, setSelectedModel] = useState('');

  const handleMakeChange = (e) => {
    setSelectedMake(e.target.value);
    setSelectedModel(''); // Reset model when make changes
  };

  const handleModelChange = (e) => {
    setSelectedModel(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <label>
        Select Make:
        <select value={selectedMake} onChange={handleMakeChange}>
          <option value="">--Choose Make--</option>
          {Object.keys(carData).map((make) => (
            <option key={make} value={make}>
              {make}
            </option>
          ))}
        </select>
      </label>

      {selectedMake && (
        <label>
          Select Model:
          <select value={selectedModel} onChange={handleModelChange}>
            <option value="">--Choose Model--</option>
            {carData[selectedMake].map((model) => (
              <option key={model} value={model}>
                {model}
              </option>
            ))}
          </select>
        </label>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default CarDropdown;
```

### 3. **Explanation:**
- The `carData` object stores your makes as keys and the corresponding models as arrays.
- The first dropdown selects the `make`, and upon selection, it triggers the population of the second dropdown (`model`) with models corresponding to the selected make.
- The `useState` hooks keep track of the selected values and update accordingly.

### 4. **Optimize for Large Data (Optional):**
For 11,000 rows, this approach works efficiently. However, if performance becomes an issue, you can:
- Load the data in chunks or asynchronously.
- Use memoization with React hooks (`useMemo`) to avoid recalculating the models on every render.

Let me know if you'd like help with optimizing or loading this data dynamically!
